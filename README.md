# Testing

There are a total of 9 tests to ensure that each API endpoint and each of its allowed HTTP methods work properly.
<br>

Run the tests

```jsx
npm run test
```

<br>

It should output something similar to this

```cmd
 PASS  src/controllers/__tests__/message.test.js
 PASS  src/controllers/__tests__/subscription.test.js
 PASS  src/controllers/__tests__/token.test.js

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       9 passed, 9 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        7.1 s
Ran all test suites.
```

<br>

<aside>ðŸ’¡ These tests are targeting the controllers. For the moment, there are no integration tests at the API endpoint level.
<br>
<br>

ðŸ’¡ Integration tests at endpoint level are pending.
