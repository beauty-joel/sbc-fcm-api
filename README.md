# Description

This is an implementation of Firebase Cloud Messaging server. It allows to send messages to android/ios devices using differerent strategies. It uses a Firestore database to persit data.

# Project Structure

This project is composed of single app, `api`. The `api` app serves API endpoints of the project.
<br> <br>

# Installation

install the dependencies

```jsx
pip install

```

Run the server in develeopment mode

```jsx
npm run dev
```

<br>

# Environment Variables

It is necesary to provide a GCP service account json file key with valid permissions to access both services, Firestore Databases and Cloud Messaging. <br>

```jsx
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = "example-file-name.json";
FIRESTORE_URL = "https://example-firebase-url.com";
PORT = 3000;
TESTING_DEVICE_TOKEN = "example-device-token-123123123";
```

<br> <br>

# API Endpoints

The `api` app has a total of 9 endpoints.

# Testing

There are a total of 9 tests to ensure that each API endpoint and each of its allowed HTTP methods work properly.
<br>

Run the tests

```jsx
npm run test
```

<br>

It should output something similar to this

```cmd
 PASS  src/controllers/__tests__/message.test.js
 PASS  src/controllers/__tests__/subscription.test.js
 PASS  src/controllers/__tests__/token.test.js

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       9 passed, 9 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        7.1 s
Ran all test suites.
```

<br>

<aside>ðŸ’¡ These tests are targeting the controllers. For the moment, there are no integration tests at the API endpoint level.
<br>
<br>

ðŸ’¡ Integration tests at endpoint level are pending.

## When subscribing to topic

1.  Validar los parametros del request
2.  Validar la existencia del documento 'deviceTokens' con el email solicitado
3.  Subscribir al topic
4.  Agregar el topic al documento 'tokenDetails'
5.  Crear o Actualizar el documento 'topicDetails' para el conteo de subscriptores y detalles

## Documentos de la base de datos

accounts: [
email: {
tokens: []
}
]

tokens: [
token: {
createdAt: timeStamp,
deviceType: android/ios
account: test@email.com
topics: [topic1, topic2]
}
]

topics: [
topic: {
noSubscriptors: 10
createdAt: timeStamp,
updatedAt: timeStamp,
status: true/false
}
]

# TODOS

    - Change email logic
    - When a token is added to an existing account, subscribe to topics...
    - Delete topic if zero subscribers...

# Notes

- If we want to keep the API 'agnostic' we should perstist info about which app is sending the request.
- What's going to append if the user changes his email in only one app

# TODO's
